# Task 12: Time-Series Complexity (Causality and Deep Learning)

The client wants to know the exact minimum time before failure that maintenance should be scheduled. Describe how you would use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or LSTM to model the temporal dependencies differently than your Part 1 models, and how an interpretability framework (like SHAP) could be applied to its outputs to better inform the maintenance lead time decision.
